          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p> Here is a list of terms and phrases and their definitions I use to describe the boba franchises:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>classic teahouse</strong> a franchise specializing in tea-based drinks.
              They are most likely to lack artificial flavorings and "Western" flavors, including
              fruits and berries such as coconut and strawberry, as well as "Western" drink
              textures such as smoothies.</li>
            <li><strong>bubble tea</strong> a beverage that comes with tapioca pearls as a set
              (non-removable).</li>
            <li><strong>drinks</strong> customizable or specialized (unique to franchise)
              beverages.</li>
            <li><strong>drink customization</strong> mainly refers to the ability to adjust sugar
              and ice levels, but can also include the availability of drink size options and
              topping selections.</li>
            <li><strong>fusion</strong> counterpart to <em>classic teahouse</em>. A <em>fusion</em>
              franchise usually has an overwhelmingly large amount of menu options in order to
              cater to a wider range of taste palettes. Most likely includes "Western" flavors
              and drink textures.</li>
            <li><strong>tea</strong> describes a beverage using freshly brewed tea from leaves,
              rather than a powder base.</li>
            <li><strong>traditional flavors</strong> can refer to classic teahouse flavors such as
              black, green, or oolong tea, but can refer to a "deeper level" of tradition in the
              case of franchises offering traditional desserts (flavors such as purple rice,
              sweet potato, mung bean, etc.).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Top Franchises & Orders</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Gong Cha</strong> - Matcha Tea Latte w/ original milk foam and pearl</li>
            <li><strong>Sharetea</strong>
              <ul><li>Matcha Green Tea Creama w/ pearl</li>
                <li>Honey Milk Tea w/ pearl</li></ul>

                <li>Matcha Milk Tea w/ pearl</li></ul>
          </ol>
          <p>I always order with the lowest sugar level next to 0 and no ice, or hot if it's
            chilly outside!

          <h2>sooooo... Why The Boba Diaries???</h2>
          <p>Boba is not so much an obsession or addiction than it is a lifestyle for me. It may
            sound crazy, and yes, nowadays there are many who obsess over bubble tea too â€” it's not
            just me. However, I think I can set myself apart from the rest, as it is a
            <em>lifestyle</em>. Boba is often the highlight of a day for me; something about it
            actually makes me happy. For example, when I go on trips, the most exciting thing to me
            is visiting boba locations that are new to me and aren't available where I live.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Japan?</h2>
          <p>I've been studying the Japanese language for six years and have visited the country
            a couple times. The tapioca craze has recently gone on steriods there, just in time for
            my most recent trip. Japan is also the only "real" foreign country
            <span class="note">*sorry Canada*</span> I've travelled to and therefore have been
            able to discover boba-wise.
          </p>
          <p>In particular, my most recent trip to Japan was the first I actively went boba-hunting
            (an actual newly-made vocabulary word in Japanese) in the country. Prior to this trip,
            I loved the drink for its sweetness in particular, always refusing to order less than
            100% sugar. However, because my favorite flavor is matcha (powder green tea), and Japan
            is the home of it, I've come to realize the true flavors of the "tea" in "bubble tea."
            Now, I can't stand anything over 30% sugar!
