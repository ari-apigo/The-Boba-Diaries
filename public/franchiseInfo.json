     "review": "Boba Up is the first self-serve style bubble tea franchise in the area. To accommodate for differences in sweetness preferences, most drinks are very watered down, requiring customers to personally add shots of sugar into their drink (which is quite unsettling). Toppings are buffet-style, but do not seem to be kept chilled or warmed."

In addition to their regular menu, they have a secret menu that rotates every month."
