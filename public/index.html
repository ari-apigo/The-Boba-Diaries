  This is the index.html file for my "The Boba Diaries" site, and this serves as a homepage.
  It features basic information regarding bubble tea and a list of bubble tea franchises that
  display franchise-specific information when a franchise name is clicked. Franchise information
  is sourced from The Boba API.
  The navigation bar at the top of the page offers the user links to the site's other pages.
  It's been so many CPs and not one about boba?!

          <h2>Welcome to The Boba Diaries!</h2>
          <p> This is my personal documentation of all bubble tea locations I have visited. Reviews
            are my <em>personal opinion!</em> Otherwise, each location's general information is
            sourced from <a href="theBobaAPI.html">The Boba API</a>.

          <h2>What is boba?</h2>
          <!-- The following site was consulted for information:
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca_balls -->
          <p>Boba are chewy tapioca pearls. Tapioca is a starch extracted from the cassava root.
            Tapioca pearls originated as a cheaper alternative to pearl sago in Southeast Asia,
            where starch-based jelly-like desserts and drinks originated. Tapioca pearls themselves
            lack flavor and gel easily, so they are often kept in syrups (sugar, honey, etc.) after
            cooking to enhance flavor and sweetness.
          </p>
          <h2>so... Why The Boba Diaries?</h2>
          <p>Recently, bubble tea's popularity has exploded worldwide. It's a mystery to me as to
            why it suddenly became extremely popular; I've been enjoying it for as long as I can
            remember. Throughout high school, my friends called me "The Boba Queen" for
            <em>always</em> drinking it, for <em>always</em> wanting it, and for knowing
            <em>everything</em> about it.

        <!-- The following site was consulted for information:

        <p>Bubble tea is a tea-based drink often mixed with other ingredients, such as milk and
          various toppings. I simply use the word "boba" to refer to a drink with tapioca pearls as
          a topping.
