          <h2>Welcome to The Boba Diaries!</h2>
          <p> This is my personal documentation of all bubble tea locations I have visited. Reviews
            are my <em>personal opinion!</em> Otherwise, each location's general information is
            sourced from <a>The Boba API</a>.

          <h2>What is boba?</h2>
          <!-- The following site was consulted for information:
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca_balls -->
          <p>Boba are chewy tapioca pearls. Tapioca is a starch extracted from the cassava root.
            Tapioca pearls originated as a cheaper alternative to pearl sago in Southeast Asia,
            where starch-based jelly-like desserts and drinks originated. Tapioca pearls themselves
            lack flavor and gel easily, so they are often kept in syrups (sugar, honey, etc.) after
            cooking to enhance flavor and sweetness.
          </p>
          <h2>so... Why The Boba Diaries?</h2>
          <p>Recently, bubble tea's popularity has exploded worldwide. It's a mystery to me as to
            why it suddenly became extremely popular; I've been enjoying it for as long as I can
            remember. Throughout high school, my friends called me "The Boba Queen" for
            <em>always</em> drinking it, for <em>always</em> wanting it, and for knowing
            <em>everything</em> about it.
          </p>
          <p>But it's not so much an obsession or addiction than it is a lifestyle for me. It may
            sound crazy, and yes, nowadays there are many who obsess over bubble tea too â€” it's not
            just me. However, I think I can set myself apart from the rest, as it is a
            <em>lifestyle</em>. Boba is often the highlight of a day for me; something about it
            actually makes me happy. For example, when I go on trips, the most exciting thing to me
            is visiting boba locations that are new to me and aren't available where I live.

        <p>Bubble tea is a tea-based drink often mixed with other ingredients, such as milk and
          various toppings. I simply use the word "boba" to refer to a drink with tapioca pearls as
          a topping.
