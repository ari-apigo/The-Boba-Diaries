          - 0: On assignments like HW5 you will not be required to submit an `APIDOC.md` containing the documentation for your web service. This means that you will need to include the documentation details as part of the header comment for your `app.js` file. This includes the request format, request type, description of the request, example request and example response (just like in your apidoc for this assignment). Additionally, make sure to include a brief comment above each endpoint describing its purpose. If you are unsure of how to format this, please refer to section examples from week 8 such as the tricky typing test or the hybrids exercise.
